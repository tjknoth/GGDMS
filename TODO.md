### TODO

- Write a function to actually determine if duplicates are correct.

- Develop a method for identifying when recursion should end and blocks should be sorted (no reduction?)

- If there is something wrong, find it.

- Write documentation (including github tutorial and MPI)


Notes:

File structure: compareMultiselect[suf] -> analyzeMultiselect[suf] (runTests -> compareMultiselectAlgorithms -> ) -> timingFunctions[suf] (timeBucketMultiselect) -> bucketMultiselect[suf]
